# Phonebook-Simple

This project web based phonebook in simple terms. It allows the users to enter a name and phone number belonging to the person. The persons name and number are stored in two arrays and correspond with eachother by the index number of the array. Users can find a person's number thats already entered in the array by searching their name and getting a phonenumber as an output if their name is saved in the array.

Some Ideas to implement in the project:
- Add a a way to delete phonenumbers from the phonebook
- The phonenumber input only allows intergers and no string values
