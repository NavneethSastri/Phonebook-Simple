# Phonebook-Simple

This project web based phonebook in simple terms. It allows the users to enter a name and phone number belonging to the person. The persons name and number are stored in two arrays and correspond with eachother by the index number of the array. Users can find a person's number thats already entered in the array by searching their name and getting a phonenumber as an output if their name is saved in the array.
